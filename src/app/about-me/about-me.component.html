        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am a Front-end developer based in Hannover Germany. I have built several Web-apps and finished an
            expansive Coding School, to be a frontend-developer. I have found my passion in developing Web-apps and want
            to prove myself to the working world and create beautiful Software with you.</p>

            <p>I started my career with an apprenticeship as an industrial mechanic and then continued my education for a Bachelor Professional of Metal Production and Management, where I learned to take responsibility and be solution-oriented.</p>

            <p>I have chosen the Developer Academy to pursue my interests further. The project-based teaching method with continuous feedback from experienced developers was ideal for me. I gained experience in web development with the assistance of professionals and expanded my skills in various group- as well as in individual projects. Having the opportunity to expand the problems on my demand and being encouraged, rather than limited in my creativity, were the best aspects of this training experience</p>
